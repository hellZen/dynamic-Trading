****DeMark Sequential indicator   (investopedia) 
This is my rendition of the code based on study of the book.
One noteable Item that may be missing is the establishment of a trend prior to the sequence testing

The DeMarker indicator, also known as DeM, is a technical analysis tool that compares the most recent maximum and minimum prices to the previous period's equivalent price to measure the demand of the underlying asset. From this comparison, it aims to assess the directional bias of the market. It is a member of the oscillator family of technical indicators and based on principles promoted by technical analyst Thomas DeMark.

Spec Summary:

-Marks a series of sequential numbers above and below the candles based on 4 closes ago.
-The reversal signal comes after the 9th consecutive candle closes have each closed beyond the close of their respective candle four bars ago.
-A sharp correction is likely to occur during the first four candles.
Signals of the TD Sequential Indicator
There are two basic signals that come from trading the TD Sequential strategy. The signals forecast an exhaustion in price and a high probabity for an impending correction.  

TD Sequential Bearish Signal
Let’s say we have a bullish trend. The price increases and on the way up we get the respective TD Sequential numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and so on.

The bearish signal comes at the moment when the Demark Sequential indicator gives you the number “9”. This means that the price action has closed 9 consecutive candles where each has closed higher than the candle 4 periods earlier.

The signal is even stronger if the highs of candles 8 and 9 exceed the highs of candles 6 and 7.

When you confirm this pattern, this is very likely to result in a pullback in a bearish direction. The strength of the pullback is most likely to be seen during the first four candles after the confirmation of the candle that is marked with “9”.

TD Sequential Bullish Signal
The trend you are analyzing is bearish in this case. And the numbered candles will be bearish as well. In this scenario, for a bullish signal, we will need to have nine bearish candles – each of which closes lower than the candle that is located four periods earlier.

The bullish signal comes when the Demark Sequential indicator gives you the number “9”.
The signal is even stronger when the lows of the candles labeled with 8 and 9 are lower than the lows of candles 6 and 7.

Demark Sequential Trading Strategy
It is important to note that there are various detailed rules surrounding TD Sequential that Demark lays out in his book “The New Science of Technical Analysis”, but for our purposes here, we will go over the core principles and develop a trading strategy around that.

So now, I will combine what we have learned about Demark sequential and present a basic trading system based on these concepts. We will discuss the precise entry point for this system, the level of your Stop Loss order, and the price target that we should aim for.

In this specific example, we will discuss the bearish TD Sequential signal.
Entry Point
Firstly, you need to have a bullish trend in place. Then we will need to get nine consecutive periods that each close higher than the period four candles earlier. When you get the number “9”, you should short the market at the end of that period.

Stop Loss Order
You should place your Stop above the last high of the current bullish trend. However, make sure you keep it at a relative distance, so that your position will be able to handle any added volatility that occurs at the reversal point. Having said that, we are expecting a sharp pullback in a bearish direction.
